.SH NAME
redo-targets \- print list of
.IR redo(1)
targets
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B redo-targets
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IR redo(1)
is a tool for building files and for rebuilding them if any of their dependencies have changed.
.I redo-targets
prints the list of
.IR redo(1)
targets in the current directory and its subdirectories that exist, i.e. files that would be rebuilt if given as an argument to
.IR redo-ifchange(1) .
.PP
Files that do not exist are not listed because they might not be targets anymore. For example, if you build a file and later remove it and change the build to no longer generate it, it will not be listed.
