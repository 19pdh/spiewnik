.TH REDO-SOURCES 1
.SH NAME
redo-sources \- print list of
.IR redo(1)
sources
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B redo-sources
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IR redo(1)
is a tool for building files and for rebuilding them if any of their dependencies have changed.
.I redo-sources
prints the list of
.IR redo(1)
sources in the current directory and its subdirectories that exist. A source is a file that has been listed as a dependency of another file using
.IR redo-ifchange(1)
but can not be built with
.IR redo(1) .
.PP
Files that do not exist are not listed because they might not be sources anymore. For example, if you declare a dependency on a file using
.IR redo-ifchange(1)
and later remove the file and create a dofile to generate it, it will not be listed.
.SH HISTORY
